# Particle Life

This is an optimized version of [Jeffrey Ventrella's "Clusters"](http://www.ventrella.com/Clusters/), "a particle microworld with ambiguous entities".
This optimization allows for real-time simulations with **many more particles** and therefore more complex and life-like structures.

This version is (compared to similar projects):
- **faster**: grid-based storage of particles behind the scenes allows for linear complexity *O(n)* instead of quadratic complexity *O(nÂ²)* when updating physics,
- **simpler**: behaviour of particle types (colors) only differs by one number (attraction factor) - the radii etc. are universal,
- **more fascinating**: thousands of particles can form much more life-like structures than only a few hundred.

There are two projects: A Java Program, and a
